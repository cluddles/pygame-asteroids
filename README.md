Asteroids clone written in Python/Pygame

### How to run

Setup virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run:
```
python3 main.py
```
or just `./main.py`

### To Do

There's a lot of stuff missing. The top 3 things I'd want to address:
* Game Over shouldn't exit the game
* Objects should wrap instead of floating off into infinity
* Proper player acceleration
